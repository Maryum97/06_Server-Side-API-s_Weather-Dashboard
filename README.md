<b>TITLE:</b>
06 - Server Side API's: Weather Dashboard

<b>DESCRIPTION:</b>
This repository contains the 6th homework assigned by the coding bootcamp at UOB, called the "Weather Dashboard". The application created in this homework serves the purpose of being a weather guide for a traveller, for showing them the weather conditions for several cities around the world, so that the traveller may know where and where not to spend the vacation.

The traveller using the app may learn about the weather of any city aroud the world, by typing in the name of the city in the search bar. On clicking the search button, the weather forecast of the city appears in the right hand column of the page, within the container. Additional information appears below the container, about the weather of the city for the next five days, wrapped within separate cards. The weather information includes the following aspects:

1. The name of the city
2. The current date
3. Temperature (in Fahrenheit)
4. Humidity (in %)
5. Wind speed (in MPH)
6. UV index, represented with a color indicator (green = low, yellow = moderate, and red = high)
7. The weather icon (image) displayed next to the city name

The five day forecast underneath the container does NOT include the UV index and the wind speed.

The column on the left shows the search history underneath the search bar and search button. The history displays the names of all the cities searched by the traveller. On clicking on any of the cities in the search history, the weather forecast of that city reappears on the screen.
